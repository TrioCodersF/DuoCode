# DuoCode
 A proof-of-concept for a real-time collaborative coding environment. This project aims to streamline pair programming and technical teamwork. Currently leverages Next.js, WebSockets, and Yjs for core functionality.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (version 16 or later)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/TrioCodersF/DuoCode.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install` 
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

## Development Roadmap

* **Upcoming Features:**
    * Improved code highlighting using Prism.js.
    * In-app text chat for easy collaboration.
    * Basic version control integration with Git.

* **Challenges and Solutions:**
    * **Minimizing Latency:** Exploring techniques to optimize data exchange for a near-instantaneous experience.
    * **Conflict Resolution:**  Refining Yjs (or a similar library) usage to seamlessly handle concurrent edits.
